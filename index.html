          <h3>Positioning</h3>
          <ul>
            <h4>position: static;</h4>
              <li>Default Value.  Properties have no effect, and element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document.</li>
            <h4>position: relative;</h4>
              <li>The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document, and then offset <em>relative to itself</em> based on the values of top, right, bottom, and left properties.  The offset does not affect the position of any other elements, so the space given for the element prior to being moved is as if the position were static.</li>
            <h4>position: absolute;</h4>
              <li>The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout. The element is positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor (if any) or to the initial containing block. Its final position is determined by the values of top, right, bottom, and left.</li>
            <h4>position: fixed;</h4>
              <li>The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout. The element is positioned relative to its initial containing block, which is the viewport in the case of visual media. Its final position is determined by the values of top, right, bottom, and left.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Multiple elements can be targeted at once.  Useful for making changes to certain elements that you want to have sharing styles.</li>
          <li>* is used to select EVERY element.  Use sparingly</li>
          <li>Using a seperate file for your style sheet is best practice when working on large projects, as it keeps all the CSS in one place and means you will have to do less work to make changes acrossed the entire project.</li>
