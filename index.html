          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Focus on using the proper elements for the job so that the page is more accessible for screen readers and other assisted browsing technologies.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Multiple elements can be targeted at once.  Useful for making changes to certain elements that you want to have sharing styles.</li>
          <li>* is used to select EVERY element.  Use sparingly</li>
          <li>Using a seperate file for your style sheet is best practice when working on large projects, as it keeps all the CSS in one place and means you will have to do less work to make changes acrossed the entire project.</li>
