# Prework Study Guide

## Description

This is a short study guide created with the guidance of the prework module for my bootcamp.  It serves as a place to take notes on some of the specific topics we will be learning about throughout the course of the bootcamp. I was able to use this project to re-familiarize myself with some of the basics of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and the basic workflow of using Git to push/pull from repos. 

## Features
Included in the JS file is a randomly generated console message that instructs the user on which of the topics they should study first. 

## Credits

All aspects of the project were basically following along with a tutorial included in the pre-work portion of the bootcamp.
